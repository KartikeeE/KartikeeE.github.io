        <p style="color: black; font-weight: 400;font-size:larger;">
The project examines a combination of economic and infrastructural variables that determine India's health outcomes, as measured by life expectancy.<br>

The project explores how improvements in social and economic determinants of health visibly correlate with increased life expectancy in India, using open-access data from the World Bank.

      <section id="data" class="content-section">
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p style="color: black; font-weight: 400;font-size:larger;">
All data was obtained from open and publicly available sources. The primary source of data was the World Bank’s Development Indicators (WDI). <br>
<br>
The indicators this project looks at are:<br>
<br>
1.	Health outcome: Life Expectancy at Birth (years) <br>
2.	GDP per capital (USD)<br>
3.	Health expenditure per capital (USD) <br>
4.	Universal Health Coverage Service Index (0-100) <br>
5.	Out of pocket health expenditure (% of current health expenditure)<br>
6.	Basic sanitation access (% of the population) <br>
<br>
The data was accessed in two ways, direct API access and automated batch downloads. For the direct API access method, raw data was obtained from the WDI URLs and imported into a JSON file. It was then embedded into the Vega-Lite editor examples. The automated batch download method was used in Python to loop through indicators, combine datasets, and download and store the data in tidy, long-form.

        <h2>Data cleaning and analysis</h2>
        <p style="color: black; font-weight: 400;font-size:larger;">
Frequent challenges faced in the project included identifying variables with consistent data in India, for example, inconsistent coverage across time frames, and large CSV files of raw data.<br>

These challenges were addressed by choosing variables that were available and relevant to the topic, changing the examined time frames for all data for consistency, and cleaning the CSV data sets to keep only relevant data.<br>

For data analysis, Python was used to clean, reshape, and standardise the data. Pandas was used to filter years, drop missing values, and convert the datasets to tidy, long-form data to make them consistent for use across charts.<br>

Data visualisation was done using Vega-lite. Interactive elements were added to allow the viewer to examine changes in the data over time (life expectancy) and to compare different variables over time (life expectancy, GDP per capita, and health expenditure per capita). For charts such as life expectancy, the axes were adjusted to start at 50 years instead of 0 to ensure the data was well represented and the long-term trends were visible.<br>

      <section id="conclusions" class="content-section">
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
               <p style="color: black; font-weight: 400;font-size:larger;">

The overall long-term trends indicate that improvements in socio-economic factors that determine health improve health outcomes in India.<br>

As GDP per capita and health expenditure per capita increased significantly, so did life expectancy.<br>

Similarly, along with these variables, the Universal Health Coverage significantly increased, while out-of-pocket health expenditures dropped.<br>

A final cross-country comparison shows where India stands in its relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita.<br>
